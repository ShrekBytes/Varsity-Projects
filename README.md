## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Project A
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ source_code/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screenshots/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Project B
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ source_code/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screenshots/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Project C
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ source_code/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screenshots/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ logo.png
```

Each project has its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` file containing detailed information about the project, including its purpose, technologies used, and any relevant instructions or documentation. The `source_code/` directory holds the project's source code, and the `screenshots/` directory stores relevant screenshots or images related to the project.
